# RADAR pRMT iOS

RADAR-base pRMT app for iOS. The code is completely written in Swift. The app is work in progress, only compatible with location data. In contrast with RADAR pRMT Android, this app is not (yet) modular: all code and plugins are bundled in this single repository. This may change in the future.
