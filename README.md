# RADAR pRMT iOS

RADAR-base pRMT app for iOS 12.0 or higher. The code is completely written in Swift. The app is work in progress, and only records location data without sending it to a server. In contrast with RADAR pRMT Android, this app is not (yet) modular: all code and plugins are bundled in this single repository. This may change in the future.

# Development

Use XCode to modify the code. Dependencies are installed by Xcode using Swift package manager.
